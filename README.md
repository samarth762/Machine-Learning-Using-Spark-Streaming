# Machine-Learning-Using-Spark-Streaming
Big Data(UE19CS322) Project 2

This project is to obtain an in depth understanding of how applications in the real world work with large data streans

model.py file contains the python code to recieve the streaming data which is being streamed by stream.py file in the different batch sizes given
the file also has several ml models which are trained and tested for different sets of data
here it also finds the eroor and accuracy of different models
